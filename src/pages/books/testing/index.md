Luck always plays a role. Our job is to shrink the role luck plays.

Desirability changes our perception of “flaws.” The more we love something, the more likely we are to not just tolerate problems but reinterpret them as not problems.

A strategy based on out-friend or out-trend the competition is exhausting and fragile.

Sustained bestsellers are recommended.

When we say word of mouth (WOM) think only of honest, non- incentivized comments about either the product or the results the user got with it.

When people talk about a brand’s contest to win an iPad, or a funny viral video, they’re talking about the brand’s marketing, and that’s not the word of mouth we’re looking for.

92% say they trust recommendations from friends and family above all other forms of advertising. 70% say they trust online consumer reviews, the second most trusted recommendation above all other forms of advertising.

It’s not about our product, our company, our brand. It’s not about how the user feels about us. It’s about how the user feels about himself, in the context of whatever it is our product, service, cause helps him do and be.

They don’t say they like the product because they like the product. They say they like the product because they like themselves.

Users don’t evangelize to their friends because they like the product, they evangelize to their friends because they like their friends.

Sustained bestsellers help their users get badass results.

The don’t want to be badass at our thing. They want to be badass at what they do with it. They want badass results.

But being better is about more than just results. Being more skillful, more knowledgeable, more advanced is itself an intrinsically rewarding experience. The ability to make finer distinctions in what you can see, hear, taste, perceive in the environment can feel like a superpower.

When you’re more skilled at something, it’s as though a part of your world got an upgrade. It’s as though pre-badass-you had been experiencing the world in Standard and now a part of the world has become High Resolution.

Badass means higher resolution. Badass means deeper, richer experiences.

Don’t just upgrade your product, upgrade your users.

Badass users talk. They’re our best source of authentic, unincentivized word of mouth

Word OF Obvious (WOFO) is even better than Word Of Mouth (WoM)

Gamification awards for purchases, visits to a website, comments, etc. typically reward behavior the company wants, not what the user wants.

“Feeling loved by a brand” does not mean badass. If we love our users more than the com- petition loves theirs, the proof doesn’t live in what we do, but in what our users do as a result.

The most vulnerable time for new users is in The Suck Zone. If we lose them here, we won’t get them back. (Later we’ll look at ways to help them through it.)

Your users clawed their way over the Suck Threshold. Finally they can do something. They’re competent. Along comes the NEW AWESOME IMPROVED version. “Upgrade!” we said. “You’ll love it!” we said. And just like that, they’re back in the Suck Zone. Whether it’s a new version of a product or a new process, change is most painful when we lose previously hard-fought ability. It now takes more effort and frustration to do what we used to do.

Returning to the Suck Zone rarely seems worth it, despite promises that the upgrade will makes us more powerful.

Our users don’t have to go all the way to world-class to experience the intrinsic rewards of high resolution knowledge, skills, and results. Simply getting past the Suck Zone can feel badass

By treating users as if they were trying to be badass, we help all users build higher resolution abilities. We don’t create a separate “good but not expert” path. It’s all one path, and some go further than others.

Given a representative task in the domain, a badass performs in a superior way, more reliably

The skills we use but don’t consciously practice can slowly deteriorate, even if we’re using them every day. The phrase “use it or lose it” is misleading. “Using it” is not enough

Those who became experts practiced more effectively than experienced non-experts with the same amount of practice hours.

The single biggest problem for most people oonn mmoosstt eexxppeerrttiissee ccuurrves is having too many things on the B board

We try to learn and practice too many things simultaneously instead of nailing one thing at a time.

Practice activities that are not Deliberate Practice can be riskier than just not practicing at all.

Practice makes permanent.
