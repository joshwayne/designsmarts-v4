A friend of mine was working on a feature for a travel site that showed possible trips travelers could go on. He was adding this new page to the navigation and couldn’t decide if he should name it **Trips** or **Find a Trip**.

After a few questions about the page, I told him to name it **Trips**. Here’s why:

When it comes to naming navigation items, most problems can be solved by looking at the page and asking “**is the goal of the page is to show content or a process?**”

If it’s content, use a **noun**.

If it’s a process, use an **“action phrase”**.


### For naming content, use nouns

When I say content, I’m using the word loosely here. Basically, content is whenever the main purpose of the page is to show information (photos, articles, data, categories, etc.).

Examples:

- **Photos** (a list of photos)
- **Trips** (a list of available trips)
- **Archives** (a list of past articles)
- **Blog Categories** (a list of blog post categories)


### For naming processes, use “action phrases”

A process is simply whenever the user has to *do something* to get a result, usually by filling out a form.

Examples:

- **Search for Flights** (a form to search for flights)
- **Book Reservation** (a form to book a reservation)
- **Send a Request** (a contact form)
- **Create New Project** (a form to create a new project)

It’s tempting to use a verb by itself to keep navigation visually clean and consistent. Don’t do that. Rather than making it clever, it makes the navigation ambiguous and confusing. By removing the noun (the *what* your verb is referring to) it leaves the navigation up to interpretation.

Try to be concrete and clear with the action verb used. **View**, **Learn**, and **Explore** are weak action verbs and should probably be avoided.

If you’re having a hard time coming up with a clear action phrase because the process has multiple steps (like finding available flights and booking), only include the next step (**Search Flights**) rather than trying to include all the steps (**Search Flights and Book**).


### What if the page has both content and a process?

If it has both, decide what is the primary focus of the page and what is secondary.

For example:

![Content and Process](2015-03-17-naming-navigation/content-and-process@2x.png){: width="340px" .noborder}

If the users’ goal is to learn more about a trip that interests them, they could successfully find one without using the filtering options at all. They might use filtering, but their goal is probably to find a trip and click on it for more information. So we would say the content is primary and the filters are secondary.


### There are always exceptions

For every design rule, there’s a dozen exceptions. If you have a situation where this rule doesn’t apply, aim to be clear over clever. Your users will thank you for it.

If you have a question about designing interfaces, ask me about it on Twitter. Maybe it can be part of a future post.
